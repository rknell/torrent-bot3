During an investigation, he is attacked by Gin and Vodka who belong to a syndicate known as the Black Organization. They force him to ingest an experimental poison called APTX 4869 to kill him without leaving evidence. A rare side-effect of the poison, however, transforms him into a child instead of killing him. Adopting the pseudonym Conan Edogawa, Kudo hides his identity to investigate the Black Organization. Later, Shiho Miyano, a member of the Black Organization and creator of APTX 4869, tries to leave the syndicate after her sister's death but is captured. She attempts suicide by ingesting APTX 4869, and like Kudo, is transformed into a child. She escapes and enrolls in Conan's school under a pseudonym, Anita Hailey. During a rare encounter with the Black Organization, Conan helps the FBI plant a CIA agent, Kir, inside the Black Organization as an undercover spy.","origin_country":["JP"],"poster_path":"http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w342/7V2Ey3Owy7a7zp2ZvQze8xSFSoe.jpg","popularity":2.613619,"name":"Detective Conan","vote_average":8.9,"vote_count":5},"seasons":{"2015":{"07-01":{"sources":[{"magnetUri":"magnet:?xt=urn:btih:9A991D43A5551E117A8E43F88B7CDAEC0CDB35F0&dn=Conan+2015+07+01+Maya+Rudolph+HDTV+x264+CROOKS&tr=udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969/announce&tr=udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969&tr=udp://open.demonii.com:1337","quality":"SD","originalName":"Conan (2010) 2015-07-01"},{"magnetUri":"magnet:?xt=urn:btih:567A3552A75D46DC4BB33F4629F287D503B7255C&dn=Conan+2015+07+01+Maya+Rudolph+720p+HDTV+x264+CROOKS&tr=udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969/announce&tr=udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969&tr=udp://open.demonii.com:1337","quality":"720p","originalName":"Conan (2010) 2015-07-01 720p"}],"info":{"status_code":34,"status_message":"The resource you requested could not be found.","still_path":"http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w300undefined"}},"06-30":{"sources":[{"magnetUri":"magnet:?xt=urn:btih:4932DDD1066A323E96495D276B10C6D715750740&dn=Conan+2015+06+30+Kumail+Nanjiani+720p+HDTV+x264+CROOKS&tr=udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969/announce&tr=udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969&tr=udp://open.demonii.com:1337","quality":"720p","originalName":"Conan (2010) 2015-06-30 Jane Lynch, Conor McGregor, John Roy 720p"},{"magnetUri":"magnet:?xt=urn:btih:BD5331B539C2E4AD41AC7CDDA49A5F4F8E3C91A8&dn=Conan+2015+06+30+Kumail+Nanjiani+HDTV+x264+CROOKS&tr=udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969/announce&tr=udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969&tr=udp://open.demonii.com:1337","quality":"SD","originalName":"Conan (2010) 2015-06-30 Jane Lynch, Conor McGregor, John Roy"}],"info":{"status_code":34,"status_message":"The resource you requested could not be found.","still_path":"http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w300undefined"}}}}},"WAYWARD PINES":{"info":{"backdrop_path":"http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/unEuJTz88F0Bft99RNi0KAgtK27.jpg","first_air_date":"2015-05-14","genre_ids":[18,9648,53],"id":53425,"original_language":"en","original_name":"Wayward Pines","overview":"Imagine the perfect American town... beautiful homes, manicured lawns, children playing safely in the streets.

Five seasons of NXT were broadcast from February 23, 2010 to June 13, 2012, in which NXT was presented as a hybrid between reality television and WWE's scripted live event shows, the premise of the show followed select talent contracted to WWE's developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling in a competition to become WWE's next breakout star with the help of mentors from WWE's Raw and SmackDown brands. The first four seasons saw Wade Barrett, Kaval, Kaitlyn, and Johnny Curtis winning NXT. In the later stages of season five, the all-rookie competition was abandoned with no winner being officially named, although Derrick Bateman was the final remaining rookie on NXT Redemption after both Titus O'Neil and Darren Young were signed to the SmackDown brand. Following the end of the fifth season, WWE ended the seasonal competition format of the show and renamed its developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling to NXT Wrestling. This article focuses on the five seasons and not the later developmental territory.\n\nThe show originally made its debut on Syfy in February 2010, replacing ECW, which concluded the previous week. Less than a month after its premiere, it was announced that WWE SmackDown would move from MyNetworkTV to Syfy in October. NXT aired its final episode on Syfy on September 28, 2010 to make way for SmackDown, and began airing as a webcast at WWE.com for visitors from the United States from October 5, 2010 to June 13, 2012. WWE NXT is not broadcast on television in the United States, but is currently broadcast on Hulu Plus. Outside of the United States, the show is still televised.","origin_country":["US"],"poster_path":"http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w342null","popularity":0.021428,"name":"WWE NXT","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0},"seasons":{"2015":{"07-01":{"sources":[{"magnetUri":"magnet:?xt=urn:btih:2C35AB456137A0A3FA51FB150642583ED5A5F9B2&dn=WWE+NXT+2015+07+01+WEBRip+h264+KYR&tr=udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969/announce&tr=udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969&tr=udp://open.demonii.com:1337","quality":"SD","originalName":"WWE NXT 2015-07-01"}],"info":{"status_code":34,"status_message":"The resource you requested could not be found.","still_path":"http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w300undefined"}}}}},"RAY DONOVAN":{"info":{"backdrop_path":"http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/jlHJgu6pF6a1iywrlLw6uyh1bYn.jpg","first_air_date":"2013-06-30","genre_ids":[18],"id":1423,"original_language":"en","original_name":"Ray Donovan","overview":"Ray Donovan, a professional \"fixer\" for the rich and famous in L.A., can make anyone's problems disappear except those created by his own family.","origin_country":["US"],"poster_path":"http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w342/gadw1SWHwIb1o8Hq7YgdHmBx21f.jpg","popularity":2.080394,"name":"Ray Donovan","vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":15},"seasons":{"3":{"1":{"sources":[{"magnetUri":"magnet:?xt=urn:btih:EA7C5CC99D90C6F85E226236B6832D7CF168418C&dn=Ray+Donovan+S03E01+720p+HDTV+x264+BATV&tr=udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969/announce&tr=udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969&tr=udp://open.demonii.com:1337","quality":"720p","originalName":"Ray Donovan 3x01 The Kalamazoo 720p"},{"magnetUri":"magnet:?xt=urn:btih:F801723F82F27C20F7C6104C6FFADD204135BCA9&dn=Ray+Donovan+S03E01+HDTV+x264+BATV&tr=udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969/announce&tr=udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969&tr=udp://open.demonii.com:1337","quality":"SD","originalName":"Ray Donovan 3x01 The Kalamazoo"},{"magnetUri":"magnet:?xt=urn:btih:18BB7BCD94D882E2CCAEAE52A24260F7DFB24783&dn=ray+donovan+s03e01+hdtv+x264+batv+ettv&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.publicbt.com%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","quality":"SD","originalName":"Ray Donovan S03E01 HDTV x264-BATV[ettv]"}],"info":{"air_date":"2015-07-12","crew":[],"episode_number":1,"guest_stars":[],"name":"The Kalamazoo","overview":"","id":1063304,"production_code":null,"season_number":3,"still_path":"http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w300null","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0}}}}},"MASTERS OF SEX":{"info":{"backdrop_path":"http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/bPvom4oTC8HQwA9jDDjO9rP6MSZ.jpg","first_air_date":"2013-09-29","genre_ids":[18],"id":58937,"original_language":null,"original_name":"Masters of Sex","overview":"William Masters and Virginia Johnson are real-life pioneers of the science of human sexuality.

It is the British version of the Dutch Big Brother television format, which takes its name from the character in George Orwell's 1949 novel Nineteen Eighty-Four.\n\nBig Brother, along with its spin-off series Celebrity Big Brother, was originally broadcast on Channel 4 from 18 July 2000 until 10 September 2010, after which it was dropped from Channel 4's schedules due to declining ratings. The rights to the programme were acquired by Channel 5 in a two-year contract with Endemol to air on the main channel and subsidiary channel 5*. The re-launched version premiered on 18 August 2011 with a back-to-back series of Celebrity Big Brother and Big Brother.\n\nThe host of Big Brother for the duration of its run on Channel 4 was Davina McCall, who was replaced by Brian Dowling when the show moved to Channel 5. Marcus Bentley has narrated the show since its inception on Channel 4. Spin-off shows that co-existed with the Channel 4 series were presented by Dermot O'Leary, Russell Brand, George Lamb and Emma Willis, who returned to present the only spin-off show Big Brother's Bit on the Side alongside Jamie East and Alice Levine when the show began on Channel 5. On 2 April 2013, it was announced that Willis would be the main Big Brother presenter.","origin_country":["GB"],"poster_path":"http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w342/u5WlsOMrk7m4cHBwFtbn18u6lgS.jpg","popularity":8.933679,"name":"Big Brother","vote_average":10,"vote_count":1},"seasons":{"16":{"51":{"sources":[{"magnetUri":"magnet:?xt=urn:btih:ED8606DF666542E6B74BC2DB5B764AF0B76AA46C&dn=Big+Brother+UK+S16E51+HDTV+x264+C4TV&tr=udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969/announce&tr=udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969&tr=udp://open.demonii.com:1337","quality":"SD","originalName":"Big Brother (UK) 16x51 Day 50"},{"magnetUri":"magnet:?xt=urn:btih:23346BC8698187015988B5D2B0FD1C9EA234B024&dn=Big+Brother+UK+S16E51+720p+HDTV+x264+C4TV&tr=udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969/announce&tr=udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969&tr=udp://open.demonii.com:1337","quality":"720p","originalName":"Big Brother (UK) 16x51 Day 50 720p"}],"info":{"air_date":"2015-07-01","crew":[],"episode_number":51,"guest_stars":[],"name":"Day 50","overview":"","id":1081106,"production_code":null,"season_number":16,"still_path":"http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w300/7mArr8M8GopoPXnSN5753H1KH4y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0}}}}},"DOLL   EM":{"info":{"backdrop_path":"http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/8FYKuhyppjY1XMosYlCcroG2WUN.jpg","first_air_date":"2014-02-18","genre_ids":[35],"id":61059,"original_language":"en","original_name":"Doll & Em","overview":"Doll & Em is a British comedy series starring real-life friends Emily Mortimer (Em) and Dolly Wells (Doll), filmed in the style of a reality TV show.

It is the British version of the Dutch Big Brother television format, which takes its name from the character in George Orwell's 1949 novel Nineteen Eighty-Four.\n\nBig Brother, along with its spin-off series Celebrity Big Brother, was originally broadcast on Channel 4 from 18 July 2000 until 10 September 2010, after which it was dropped from Channel 4's schedules due to declining ratings. The rights to the programme were acquired by Channel 5 in a two-year contract with Endemol to air on the main channel and subsidiary channel 5*. The re-launched version premiered on 18 August 2011 with a back-to-back series of Celebrity Big Brother and Big Brother.\n\nThe host of Big Brother for the duration of its run on Channel 4 was Davina McCall, who was replaced by Brian Dowling when the show moved to Channel 5. Marcus Bentley has narrated the show since its inception on Channel 4. Spin-off shows that co-existed with the Channel 4 series were presented by Dermot O'Leary, Russell Brand, George Lamb and Emma Willis, who returned to present the only spin-off show Big Brother's Bit on the Side alongside Jamie East and Alice Levine when the show began on Channel 5. On 2 April 2013, it was announced that Willis would be the main Big Brother presenter.","origin_country":["GB"],"poster_path":"http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w342/u5WlsOMrk7m4cHBwFtbn18u6lgS.jpg","popularity":8.933679,"name":"Big Brother","vote_average":10,"vote_count":1},"seasons":{"17":{"4":{"sources":[{"magnetUri":"magnet:?xt=urn:btih:B0DF0A7EBAFD24BC83491D792A71823C615705C0&dn=Big+Brother+US+S17E04+HDTV+x264+2HD&tr=udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969/announce&tr=udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969&tr=udp://open.demonii.com:1337","quality":"SD","originalName":"Big Brother US 17x04"},{"magnetUri":"magnet:?xt=urn:btih:B2D580182961C9804D9C80A024546B0CB1A4D0F8&dn=Big+Brother+US+S17E04+720p+HDTV+x264+2HD&tr=udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969/announce&tr=udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969&tr=udp://open.demonii.com:1337","quality":"720p","originalName":"Big Brother US 17x04 720p"}],"info":{"status_code":34,"status_message":"The resource you requested could not be found.","still_path":"http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w300undefined"}}}}},"MASTERCHEF":{"info":{"backdrop_path":"http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/3IUOyNv32iMKAMcqXZt2EuanArd.jpg","first_air_date":"2010-07-27","genre_ids":[10764],"id":40290,"original_language":"en","original_name":"MasterChef","overview":"MasterChef is a U.S. competitive cooking reality show, open to amateur and home chefs.

Created by Simon Cowell, the show began in September 2004 and has since aired annually from August/September through to December. The show is produced by FremantleMedia's Thames and Cowell's production company SYCOtv. It is broadcast on the ITV network in the United Kingdom and TV3 in Ireland, with spin-off behind-the-scenes show The Xtra Factor screened on ITV2. It is the originator of the international The X Factor franchise. The X Factor was devised as a replacement for the highly successful Pop Idol, which was put on indefinite hiatus after its second series, largely because Cowell, who was a judge on Pop Idol, wished to launch a show to which he owned the television rights. The perceived similarity between the two shows later became the subject of a legal dispute. The \"X Factor\" of the title refers to the undefinable \"something\" that makes for star quality.\n\nThe original judging panel was Cowell, Sharon Osbourne and Louis Walsh. Dannii Minogue joined the panel in series 4, and Cheryl Cole replaced Osbourne in series 5 after her departure. After series 7, Cowell and Cole both left to judge the American version of the show whilst Minogue left the show due to commitments on Australia's Got Talent. Kelly Rowland, Tulisa Contostavlos and Gary Barlow then joined Walsh on the judging panel for series 8, though Rowland announced she would not return for series 9 and was replaced by Nicole Scherzinger. Osbourne later returned in 2013, replacing Contostavlos. Since 2007, the show has been presented by Dermot O'Leary, who replaced original host Kate Thornton. The show is split into a series of phases, following the contestants from auditions through to the grand finale. In the original televised audition phase of the show, contestants sang in an audition room in front of just the judges. From series 6 onwards, auditionees sing on a stage in front of the judges and a live audience. Successful auditionees go through to \"bootcamp\" and then to \"judges' houses\", where judges narrow down the acts in their category down to three or four acts to mentor for the live shows, where the public vote for their favourite acts following weekly live performances by the contestants.","origin_country":["GB"],"poster_path":"http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w342/grbtxG0peBrACueHOUtOg5Zmta9.jpg","popularity":0.116092,"name":"The X Factor (UK)","vote_average":0,"vote_count":1},"seasons":{"11":{"34":{"sources":[{"magnetUri":"magnet:?xt=urn:btih:BD3AC4F0E87390E77AB1336A9C781255B1CBE1E1&dn=the+x+factor+uk+s11e34+720p+hdtv+x264+ftp+rarbg&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.publicbt.com%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","quality":"720p","originalName":"The X Factor UK S11E34 720p HDTV x264-FTP[rarbg]"}],"info":{"air_date":"2014-12-14","crew":[],"episode_number":34,"guest_stars":[],"name":"Series 11, The Final Extra (Result)","overview":"","id":1024253,"production_code":null,"season_number":11,"still_path":"http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w300null","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0}}}}},"AMERICAN IDOL":{"info":{"backdrop_path":"http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/xTlPtqlZWsywV06ZB75dVSdM4Am.jpg","first_air_date":"2002-06-11","genre_ids":[10764],"id":3626,"original_language":"en","original_name":"American Idol","overview":"American Idol is an American reality-singing competition program created by Simon Fuller.

Created by Simon Cowell, the show began in September 2004 and has since aired annually from August/September through to December. The show is produced by FremantleMedia's Thames and Cowell's production company SYCOtv. It is broadcast on the ITV network in the United Kingdom and TV3 in Ireland, with spin-off behind-the-scenes show The Xtra Factor screened on ITV2. It is the originator of the international The X Factor franchise. The X Factor was devised as a replacement for the highly successful Pop Idol, which was put on indefinite hiatus after its second series, largely because Cowell, who was a judge on Pop Idol, wished to launch a show to which he owned the television rights. The perceived similarity between the two shows later became the subject of a legal dispute. The \"X Factor\" of the title refers to the undefinable \"something\" that makes for star quality.\n\nThe original judging panel was Cowell, Sharon Osbourne and Louis Walsh. Dannii Minogue joined the panel in series 4, and Cheryl Cole replaced Osbourne in series 5 after her departure. After series 7, Cowell and Cole both left to judge the American version of the show whilst Minogue left the show due to commitments on Australia's Got Talent. Kelly Rowland, Tulisa Contostavlos and Gary Barlow then joined Walsh on the judging panel for series 8, though Rowland announced she would not return for series 9 and was replaced by Nicole Scherzinger. Osbourne later returned in 2013, replacing Contostavlos. Since 2007, the show has been presented by Dermot O'Leary, who replaced original host Kate Thornton. The show is split into a series of phases, following the contestants from auditions through to the grand finale. In the original televised audition phase of the show, contestants sang in an audition room in front of just the judges. From series 6 onwards, auditionees sing on a stage in front of the judges and a live audience. Successful auditionees go through to \"bootcamp\" and then to \"judges' houses\", where judges narrow down the acts in their category down to three or four acts to mentor for the live shows, where the public vote for their favourite acts following weekly live performances by the contestants.","origin_country":["GB"],"poster_path":"http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w342/grbtxG0peBrACueHOUtOg5Zmta9.jpg","popularity":0.116092,"name":"The X Factor (UK)","vote_average":0,"vote_count":1},"seasons":{"3":{"3":{"sources":[{"magnetUri":"magnet:?xt=urn:btih:35E15F5E62BF6A885B4F62817C0CD7747D7D16F8&dn=the+x+factor+us+s03e03+hdtv+x264+bajskorv+ettv&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.publicbt.com%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","quality":"SD","originalName":"The X Factor US S03E03 HDTV x264-BAJSKORV[ettv]"}],"info":{"air_date":"2006-09-02","crew":[],"episode_number":3,"guest_stars":[],"name":"Series 3 - Open Auditions 3","overview":"","id":511556,"production_code":null,"season_number":3,"still_path":"http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w300null","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0}}}}},"THE FOLLOWING":{"info":{"backdrop_path":"http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/mFELuvz7tiz3EMvpw96eO2IXBRw.jpg","first_air_date":"2013-01-21","genre_ids":[18],"id":45094,"original_language":null,"original_name":"The Following","overview":"Notorious serial killer Joe Carroll, after being found guilty of murdering 14 female students on the Virginia college campus where he taught literature, escapes from death row.
